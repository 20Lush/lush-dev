# lush-dev
Debian based container for developing with my projects (without having to cross-compile to windows LOL)

# Usage
This repo's images are stored in the Github Container Registry! Use the command below to pull the image.
```bash
    docker pull ghcr.io/20lush/lush-dev:latest
```
The scripts I use to launch my containers and do some management are found in this repository as well, though YMMV and I cannot guarantee for them to work everywhere.
